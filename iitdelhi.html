    <h1>ABOUT IIT DELHI</h1>

    <p>
      Indian Institute of Technology Delhi is one of the 23 IITs created to be Centres of Excellence for training,
      research and development in science, engineering and technology in India.

      Established as College of Engineering in 1961, the Institute was later declared as an Institution of National
      Importance under the “Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Act, 1963” and was renamed as “Indian Institute of
      Technology Delhi”. It was then accorded the status of a Deemed University with powers to decide its own academic
      policy, to conduct its own examinations, and to award its own degrees.

      Since its inception, over 48000 have graduated from IIT Delhi in various disciplines including Engineering,
      Physical Sciences, Management and Humanities & Social Sciences. Of these, nearly 5070 received Ph.D. degrees. The
      number of students who graduated with B.Tech. degree is over 15738. The rest obtained Master’s Degree in
      Engineering, Sciences and Business Administration. These alumni today work as scientists, technologists, business
      managers and entrepreneurs. There are several alumni who have moved away from their original disciplines and have
      taken to administrative services, active politics or are with NGOs. In doing so, they have contributed
      significantly to building of this nation, and to industrialization around the world.
